# INTRODUCTION
Hi, my name's Thanh, but you can call me William. I'm studying software engineer at Ho Chi Minh City University of Foreign Language and Information Technology (HUFLIT). If you ask me what do I do in my free time, I will say that playing games with my friends, listening to K-Pop songs, singing alone, or watching horror movies. Sometimes, I will spend a little time to learn coding. About my weaknesses, I am super shy and I don't feel confident about my coding skills, and that is my weakness. However, I will try my best to improve my self and learn as many programming languages as I can for my future life :D
